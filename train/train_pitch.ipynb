    "## Load data\n",
    "Each plate appearance by the opponent has it's own csv associated with it which contains the pitching information against the oponent. For example, when a new oponent steps up to the plate, a new csv will be created and will record data against that batter until that batter gets a hit or get out. The csv is formatted as `outcome,pitch_type,pitch_direction,strikes,balls,batter_handedness`. The `outcome` of the pitch is treated as its label, and the rest of the fields are treated as the input data for the model. All of the input fields will be converted to be [one hot encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot). The first field of the one hot encoding will represent blank data. This is because the AI will consider the last n amount of pitches against a batter, where n is defined by `TIMESTEPS`. However, when throwing the first pitch against a new batter, there will be no previous pitch data to look at, so we need a way to represent this as being empty. So the one hot encoding for the `pitch_type` field will be like `[empty, fastball, screwball, curveball, splitter]`. A curveball pitch in this case would be represented as `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`."
